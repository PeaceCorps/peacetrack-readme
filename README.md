<h1>Objective of this Project</h1>

The objective of this project is to understand the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) process Peace Corps currently uses to assess the impact of Peace Corps Volunteers in the field, understand the data structure and reporting workflow changes the Agency would like to make in the future, and create a mobile solution that best represents that future desired state. This mobile application will serve as a change agent within the Agency. This application is a tangible product that represents our goal and our future, and will prepare us to go live with a better M&E tool.

This project should not just be seen as an internal change agent, but as the cornerstone tool of the future of Peace Corps Volunteer reporting on the work that they do. This effort will cause more Volunteers to report on their work, and allow Peace Corps to make data-driven decisions in all aspects of our business.

We appreciate the work of those who are helping advance this project at all levels. We are grateful for your help.
